# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is to performing the analysis on Kickstarter campaign data using the Kickstarter dataset via Microsoft Excel tools. We will visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose
The analysis is to help uncover how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. That will help look into how the launch month affect campaign outcomes and make future decision on launching potential fundraising goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis includes two technical analysis. The first one analyzes campaign outcomes based on their launch month and year. The second one analyzed campaign outcomes based on their goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The launch date could be critical to a fundraising, especially the launch season and month. Using the Kickstarter data set, we created the pivot table and chart to represent the relationship between launch time and campaign outcomes. Based on the counts of sucessful, failed and canceled outcomes through all years, we summarize the changes among different months using two filters of Category and years. We could also look into each year to reveal the relationship for specific year. Here, we focus all years from 2009 through 2017 when data is available to overview the trends.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
